Threaddit
=========

Reddit Bots to collect data from individual threads.

## FIXME

Using shelve for syncing doesn't really make sense, as requests are handled inside praw

## TODO

Make bot that posts link to orig thread in /r/ThreadditBot/ and adds a comment
with links categorized (images, videos, etc)
